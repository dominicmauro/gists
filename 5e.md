# Key 5E Concepts

Fifth Edition (5e) shares a lot of similarities with Pathfinder and previous editions. The big changes are: Advantage, Saving Throws, Skills, Proficiency Bonus, and the “1 Move, 1 Action” turn. 

## Advantage

Perhaps the biggest change in 5e is the "advantage" system. Characters (and NPCs) have an advantage to succeed on a roll in certain circumstances. For example, trying to pry open a door requires a Strength check; using a crowbar gives advantage on the Strength check. Characters can gain advantage on saving throws, skill checks, and attack rolls. Likewise, characters can have disadvantage on any of those rolls. 

In practice, a character with "**advantage**" rolls the die twice and uses the higher result. A character with "**disadvantage**" rolls the die twice and uses the lower result. If you somehow have both advantage and disadvantage on the same roll, they cancel out and you roll normally. This system replaces lots of esoteric bonuses and penalties we used to have to add up. 

With the understanding that it's impossible to list all the ways to gain advantage on skill checks and saving throws, here's a list of all the ways you can gain advantage on an attack roll:

1. Target creature can't see you
2. Attacking while an ally Helps you (see On Your Turn, below)
3. Target is prone in square adjacent to you
4. Restrained, paralyzed, stunned, or unconscious target

Some examples of having disadvantage: attacking an invisible monster, trying to sneak past some guards while wearing heavy armor, and trying to do basically anything while poisoned.

## Saving Throws

Saving throws in 5e are now ability checks. This means you don't have to keep track of whether a 4th-level fighter has a +5 to fortitude saves or a +6. You just know that you need to make a Constitution saving throw when you're poisoned, and a Wisdom saving throw when a magic spell tries to put you to sleep, etc. You roll 1d20, add your ability modifier (e.g. +4 for 18, +3 for 16, +2 for 14, and +1 for 12), and compare that to the DC of the thing you're trying to save against. See also “Proficiency Bonus” below. 

## Skills

5e has eliminated skill points; now, each class has a set of skills, and each character is "proficient" in two or more of their class's skills. Characters can still try to use should they’re not proficient in. 

Skills are named in parentheses after the ability they relate to. For example, Intelligence (History) and Dexterity (Stealth) are two skills your character might need to use. To use a skill, you roll 1d20 and add your ability modifier, just like saving throws above. See also “Proficiency Bonus” below. 

## Proficiency Bonus

Another new mechanic in 5e is the **proficiency bonus**. The proficiency bonus is something all characters have: a bonus to attacks, saving throws, and skills they're proficient in. This bonus is based on the character's level: all first-level characters have a proficiency bonus of +2, which becomes +3 at fourth-level, +4 at ninth, etc. The proficiency bonus stacks on top of the ability modifier for attacks, saving throws, and skills checks a character is proficient in. 

For example, Wizard class skills are: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, and Religion. If your character is a Wizard, you may have selected Arcana and History to be proficient in. That wizard can still use Medicine and Religion skills, or even non-Wizard skills like Stealth or Intimidation, but won't apply a proficiency bonus to them; just the ability modifiers. 

Each class applies its proficiency bonus to at least two saving throws, as well. For example, Clerics add their proficiency bonus to Wisdom and Charisma saving throws. So a Cleric making a Wisdom saving throw will roll 1d20, add their proficiency bonus **and their Wisdom modifier**, and compare that to the DC of the thing they’re saving against. 

Lastly, the proficiency bonus applies to attacks with weapons a character is proficient in. For example, Clerics are proficient with war hammers but not great axes. A Cleric attacking with a war hammer applies their proficiency bonus to that attack, but one using a great axe does not. In both cases, the Cleric would apply their strength modifier to the attack. 

## On Your Turn

Out of combat, 5e is as loose and improvised as any other RPG. Talk to NPCs, roll skill checks, wander around, etc. 

In combat, you can do two things on your turn. You get one **Move**, and one **Action**. Your movement is listed on your character sheet. It's 30 feet per round for humans, and 25 feet per round for Dwarves, Gnomes, and Halflings.

For your action, you can choose from one of ten activities:
1. **Attack**
2. **Cast a Spell**
3. **Dash**: gain one extra Movement for this turn.
4. **Disengage**: your Movement does not provoke an attack of opportunity this turn.
5. **Dodge**: attacks against you have Disadvantage until your next turn.
6. **Help**: grant Advantage to one ally attacking within five feet of you.
7. **Hide**: make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. 
8. **Ready**: get an Action prepared and take it when something happens.
9. **Search**: look for something.
10. **Use an Object**: activate a magic wand, pick a locked door, loot a monster, etc.

You take one move and one action every turn. It doesn't matter what order you do them in. You can even take your action midway through your movement, and then resume moving.

## Bonus Actions and Reactions

In addition to the "1 move, 1 action" everyone gets on their turn, characters might have **bonus** actions. A bonus action happens on your own turn. For example, Barbarians can enter a rage as a bonus action, Bards can start singing an inspirational song as a bonus action, and anyone holding a second weapon in their off-hand can attack with it as a bonus action. You only get to take one bonus action on your turn. Bards holding two weapons can’t sing and make an off-hand attack in the same turn. 

When it's not your turn, you may take a **reaction**. A reaction is a special action triggered by something else happening. The most common kind is an attack of opportunity: when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of the reach of your melee weapon, you may make an attack against that creature as a reaction. Another example: Fighters may **parry** as a reaction to being hit by an attack, reducing the damage they take. Like bonus actions, you only get one reaction in between your turns.
